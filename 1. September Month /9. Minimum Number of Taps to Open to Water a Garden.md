# Minimum Number of Taps to Open to Water a Garden

<h3>
  There is a one-dimensional garden on the x-axis. The garden starts at the point 0 and ends at the point n. (i.e., the length of the garden is n).

There are n + 1 taps located at points [0, 1, ..., n] in the garden.

Given an integer n and an integer array ranges of length n + 1 where ranges[i] (0-indexed) means the i-th tap can water the area [i - ranges[i], i + ranges[i]] if it was open.

Return the minimum number of taps that should be open to water the whole garden, If the garden cannot be watered return -1.

 

Example 1:


Input: n = 5, ranges = [3,4,1,1,0,0]
Output: 1
Explanation: The tap at point 0 can cover the interval [-3,3]
The tap at point 1 can cover the interval [-3,5]
The tap at point 2 can cover the interval [1,3]
The tap at point 3 can cover the interval [2,4]
The tap at point 4 can cover the interval [4,4]
The tap at point 5 can cover the interval [5,5]
Opening Only the second tap will water the whole garden [0,5]
Example 2:

Input: n = 3, ranges = [0,0,0,0]
Output: -1
Explanation: Even if you activate all the four taps you cannot water the whole garden.
 

Constraints:

1 <= n <= 104
ranges.length == n + 1
0 <= ranges[i] <= 100

***Solution***

```

class Solution {
public:
    int minTaps(int n, vector<int>& ranges) {
        vector<pair<int,int>> arr;
        for(int i=0;i<=n;i++)
            arr.push_back({max(0,i-ranges[i]),min(n,i+ranges[i])});
        sort(arr.begin(),arr.end());
       
        int cnt = 0;
        int index = 0;
        int last = 0;
        while(index < arr.size()){
            int reach = -1;
            while(index<arr.size() && arr[index].first <= last)
                reach = max(reach,arr[index++].second);
            if(reach == -1) return -1;
            cnt += 1;
            last = reach;
            if(last == n)   return cnt;
        }
        return -1;
    }
